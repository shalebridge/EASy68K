## Editor, Assembler, Simulator, S-Record/Binary utility for the 68000 Series microprocessor

### Since support of this software seems to have gone stale, I thought I'd find myself a copy of Borland C++ Builder 6.0 and get to work. Currently I am only focused on fixing functionality and bugs in the Asssembler, but plan on going over the other code as well.
